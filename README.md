# Scrape Webpage with Python
Author: Yang Xu (yxu6@nd.edu)

## Overview

Web scraping enables you to efficiently fetch and extract data from web pages, opening doors to information that might otherwise remain hidden or difficult to collect.

This workshop provides an introduction to web scraping using Python. Through a hands-on project, participants will learn how to use the Requests and BeautifulSoup Python package to scrape, parse and extract specific data from a webpage.

While the workshop is designed with beginners in mind, it also offers valuable learning opportunities for experienced Python users through a separate self-paced web-crawling project using Scrapy (a widely used Python web scraping framework).

Participants will learn:
1. Web scraping fundamentals.
2. The art of HTML parsing and extracting data using Beautiful Soup.
3. Precise data retrieval using regex.
4. Efficient data extraction using Scrapy (advanced).
