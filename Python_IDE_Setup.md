# Python IDE

This course requires you to have certain basics on Python programming, and of course, Python(3.7 or later) and Jupyter to be installed.

For Windows and MacOS users, it is recommended to install Anaconda, a open-platform for data science. This will set up both python and IDE all in one step.

For Linux users, you probably won't need any suggestion.

The workshop will also require some packages that can be installed through pip3 or conda:

1. tweepy
    - ```pip install scrapy``` or ```conda install -c conda-forge scrapy```
    - ```pip show scrapy```
2. pandas
3. BeautifulSoup4
   - ```conda install -c conda-forge beautifulsoup4```
   - ```pip show beautifusoup4```
